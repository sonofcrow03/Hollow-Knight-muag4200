  <p>Welcome to my analysis of sound design and emotion in Hollow Knight, a cute little video game about bugs.</p>
<br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

  <div/>
<br>Firstly, let's look at a clip below. This clip is from 'Deepnest', an area of the game designed to elicit feelings of creepy crawly sensations and malaise.</br>
    <br> </br>

  </video>
    <br></br>
      <br> In this video, the out-of-tune, flanging effect on the music immediately creates a sense of apprehension, fear, and dread: the feeling you get during near-death experiences where your stomach sinks.</br>
  <br> The sounds used after fading to black leave much to the imagination to convey terror. This is reminiscent of principles of German Expressionism, where darkness and the unknown are used as a horror device.</br>
  <br> Even in the characters and environment's designs, we see chiaroscuro reminiscent of German Expressionism, the relationship between self and other, and the concept of birth and perception </br>

  </div>
    <br> Here we see the same concepts in the design of an environment. Darkness, light, foreground, background... It elicits the idea of the fundamental battle between good and evil, the distinction between self and other, as yin and yang.</br>
    <br> Where do you stop? Where do others begin? What constitutes the outside world vs. your internal world? The following clip displays one possible ending in Hollow Knight that shines light on this.</br>

  <br> This ending is called "Dream No More". After a climactic ascent to deliver a finishing blow to The Radiance (a moth-like creature infecting the bugs in the kingdom of Hallownest), the Knight breaks free of his ego, represented by his white shell.</br>
    <br> The main conflict in this game is one between Void, Soul, and Infection. After the Infection broke out due to the Radiance, a specific bug, The Hollow Knight, was chosen to seal away the infection, thought to be a completely pure vessel incapable of thought or dreams.</br>

    <br> The Hollow Knight ends up being impure and polluted by thought, leading to the Infection's reawakening. </div>

    <br> We, the Knight, see the return of this infection, and it is our duty to once more destroy this Infection and seal it away. In this ending, we succeed. The Knight becomes one with its birthplace of the Abyss, destroying the Radiance forever.</br>
    <br> The audio alone during this ending is harrowing. Upon destroying the Radiance, it lets out a piercing scream in an attempt to maintain its sense of self. Simultaneously, its skin ego and sonorous envelope are being ripped apart by the player.</br>
    <br> Throughout the game, a glistening, ethereal sound is a symbol of the Radiance, the Infection, and Dreams. This sound slowly fades as the Radiance and consequently, the infection, are dragged into the void.</br>

    <br> The shattering of the Radiance's sonorous envelope is accompanied by its screams and pleas, begging to maintain its ego by externalizing sounds. </br>
