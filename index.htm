  <p>Welcome to my analysis of sound design and emotion in Hollow Knight, a cute little video game about bugs.</p>
<br>

<br>Firstly, let's look at a clip below. This clip is from 'Deepnest', an area of the game designed to elicit feelings of creepy crawly sensations and malaise.</br>

      <br> In this video, the out-of-tune, flanging effect on the music immediately creates a sense of apprehension, fear, and dread: the feeling you get during near-death experiences where your stomach sinks.</br>
  <br> The sounds used after fading to black leave much to the imagination to convey terror. This is reminiscent of principles of German Expressionism, where darkness and the unknown are used as a horror device.</br>
  <br> Even in the characters and environment's designs, we see chiaroscuro reminiscent of German Expressionism, the relationship between self and other, and the concept of birth and perception </br>

  </div>
    <br> Here we see the same concepts in the design of an environment. Darkness, light, foreground, background... It elicits the idea of the fundamental battle between good and evil, the distinction between self and other, as yin and yang.</br>
    <br> Where do you stop? Where do others begin? What constitutes the outside world vs. your internal world? The following clip displays one possible ending in Hollow Knight that shines light on this.</br>
