  <p>Welcome to my analysis of sound design and emotion in Hollow Knight, a cute little video game about bugs.</p>
<br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

<br>Firstly, let's look at a clip below. This clip is from 'Deepnest', an area of the game designed to elicit feelings of creepy crawly sensations and malaise.</br>
    <br></br>
  <video width="600px" controls="controls" src="Deepnest.mp4">
    <source src="Deepnest.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>(note 1)
  </video>
    <br></br>
      <br> In this video, the out-of-tune, flanging effect on the music immediately creates a sense of apprehension, fear, and dread: the feeling you get during near-death experiences where your stomach sinks.</br>
  <br> The sounds used after fading to black leave much to the imagination to convey terror. This is reminiscent of principles of German Expressionism, where darkness and the unknown are used as a horror device.</br>
  <br> Even in the characters and environment's designs, we see chiaroscuro reminiscent of German Expressionism, the relationship between self and other, and the concept of birth and perception </br>
